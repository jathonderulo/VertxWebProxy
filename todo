fix the caching. use httpbin/check http_logs and you'll understand. just doing domain isn't enough, need to do per full resource
add flexible port handling to sending http / https requests. so basically check for a port, default to default if no port specified
improve readability, extendability, see what i can refactor and then ask gpt for finish
use more verticles - check copilot chat / ask again if i'm following vertx design principles properly
finish loading config using jackson annotation jsonproperty and properties file in root
implement threading or something with more verticles anyway
fix this unhandled exception stuff at the bottom?
fix comments?
change printlns to logs
