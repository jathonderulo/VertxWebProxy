follow SOLID more. Write the principles out, think for myself, and then refer to the copilot output.
docker containerize my stuff and port map so it looks better on github
add a dependency so I can use mockito to mock external dependencies
add flexible port handling to sending http / https requests. so basically check for a port, default to default if no port specified
use more verticles - check copilot chat / ask again if i'm following vertx design principles properly
finish loading config using jackson annotation jsonproperty and properties file in root
implement threading or something with more verticles anyway
fix this unhandled exception stuff at the bottom
fix comments?
change printlns to logs
